Whew. I am SO glad\nthis is finally done.\n\nHigh level goal: Continue refining the native contracts (ref #15),\nspecifically\nwalling off their state into their own contract DBs rather than globally\nshared (read: stuff that race conditions are made of) general blockchain\nstate.\n\nThe first real change I made in this commit, which precipitated the\navalanche of changes that followed before the project became consistent\nagain, was to move the account balance out of account_object (globally\nshared) to an object known only to the Eos Contract, thus eliminating\nthe possibility of race conditions/nondeterministic behavior.\n\nThe trouble is, balances are set at genesis. Genesis is processed by\nchain_controller. chain_controller cannot know about balances, since\nthose are an abstraction defined on top of the Eos contract, which is an\nabstraction defined on top of chain_controller. So all of genesis had to\nbe reimagined, and quite a lot of architectural changes had to be made\nin order to create a logically consistent solution.\n\nChanges (probably incomplete):\n - Fix up notifications within the native contract to support\nprecondition validation as well as application\n\n - Add notify handlers for CreateAccount to Eos and Staked Balance\ncontracts\n\n - Move account's liquid balance of EOS from account_object to\nBalanceObject\n\n - Replace {producer,account}_object::id_type with AccountName most\neverywhere except block_header, which still contains a\nproducer_object::id_type (potentially in violation of protocol\nstandards, but I want to confirm that before fixing it)\n   - Reason: The name is not significantly slower, as it's fixed length so\nno heap allocs, and it simplifies the code in quite a few places by\nallowing us to look up objects directly rather than indirectly by\nlooking up an ID to get an intermediate object to get a handle for the\nobject we really wanted\n\n - Replace native_system_contract_plugin with native_contract library\n   - Reason: The plugin was getting in the way. The native system\ncontract C++ implementation is simply too fundamental unless/until we\nhave a scripted implementation that works until the native\nimplementation gets installed\n\n - Completely reimagine genesis initialization, taking it largely out of\nthe hands of chain_controller and putting it in the hands of\nnative_contract\n   - Reason: chain_controller understands relatively little about\ngenesis. It understands global_property_object and producer_object, but\nnot BalanceObject or StakedBalanceObject, etc... It also doesn't\nunderstand the native_contract, and things like installing the native\ncontract, setting up accounts/balances, etc. all need to be handled by\nsomething... native_contract is the most logical place to put it.\n\nSorry for the enormous commit... alas, this was the first time I got it\nall building again and passing tests in days.\n"},{"hash":"e1691416a8ce57f7a2b35e90d16682493943b551","date":"2017-06-09T03:42:16.000Z","author":{"name":"Nathan Hourt","email":"nat.hourt@gmail.com"},"message":"Rename context.recipient->context.scope\n\nOhh, my life would've been easier during my last commit if that rename\nhad actually been done rather than just commented about.\n"},{"hash":"e096dbd620b308dcbfc04827068f8857b24fd8fa","date":"2017-06-09T18:57:48.000Z","author":{"name":"Daniel Larimer","email":"dan.larimer@block.one"},"message":"update cmakelists\n"},{"hash":"cf631a66ee818554d763a90f14768b9595a79321","date":"2017-06-09T18:57:50.000Z","author":{"name":"Daniel Larimer","email":"dan.larimer@block.one"},"message":"Merge branch 'master' of github.com:EOSIO/eos\n"},{"hash":"994ae0921e95bc76f3a3cb713cb45f22c9afca10","date":"2017-06-11T08:23:33.000Z","author":{"name":"Matias Romeo","email":"matias.romeo@gmail.com"},"message":"Fix initial supply config constant\n"},{"hash":"f84c02873c4d5238aa04c1eeda109db6fb9071f5","date":"2017-06-12T02:30:12.000Z","author":{"name":"Matias Romeo","email":"matias.romeo@gmail.com"},"message":"Add necessary functions to support type_object serialization\n"},{"hash":"c3c5f413c354d850c25ce62de8a9705eae1ed2c4","date":"2017-06-12T04:01:15.000Z","author":{"name":"Matias Romeo","email":"matias.romeo@gmail.com"},"message":"Add API function to return account registered types\n"},{"hash":"e1a17df6e3de0ab6c732809c03dbb4a79aa9b17e","date":"2017-06-12T19:22:04.000Z","author":{"name":"Nathan Hourt","email":"nathan@followmyvote.com"},"message":"Merge pull request #30 from elmato/add-get-types-api\n\nAdd get types api"},{"hash":"185dc6328ed5e4b8b8fffb682ed8fd08acfff631","date":"2017-06-12T19:25:10.000Z","author":{"name":"Nathan Hourt","email":"nathan@followmyvote.com"},"message":"Merge pull request #29 from elmato/fix-initial-supply-constant\n\nFix initial supply config constant"},{"hash":"d0b217029b95008640a0e4f16150bea4c01c8577","date":"2017-06-13T00:13:35.000Z","author":{"name":"Nathan Hourt","email":"nat.hourt@gmail.com"},"message":"Move genesis_state_type: chain -> native_contract\n\nAftermath of 55a8470929e0ea2ebda9c7cfb9ff45038b640391 -- the chain\nlibrary no longer ever touches genesis_state_type; this type is only\nrecognized by native_contract now, so move its files from the chain\nlibrary to the native_contract library.\n"},{"hash":"411da9d859cc9a913c62f18bd33907a9a9036e7d","date":"2017-06-13T00:47:56.000Z","author":{"name":"Nathan Hourt","email":"nat.hourt@gmail.com"},"message":"Create initial producers with messages\n\nPreviously, we created the initial producers by manually making the\nproducer_object's in prepare_database.

This eats up the virtual memory space exceptionally quick.\n\nNow, only allocate 12KB per wasm/contract instance. This is enough for 1024 table elements which is hopefully plenty. The side effect is that every indirect function call now has an additional runtime check on its value (checking if it is less than 1024). This seems like an acceptable tradeoff.\n\nAlso I have removed the 4GB alignment for the table and replaced it with 4KB. I wasn’t finding any benefit to that 4GB alignment. The generated x86_64 code was simply in the form of *8(%base, %index) so I probably don’t even need 4KB.\n"},{"hash":"86124b14db78371c069c74799be4b929c785c933","date":"2018-02-07T20:51:26.000Z","author":{"name":"Bart Wyatt","email":"bart.wyatt@block.one"},"message":"temporary
