Currently it uses the DNS-lookup timeout as the timeout for opening\n   circuits as well as for actually looking up the IP numbers.  It may\n   be this timeout value, which is five seconds hard-coded into the\n   `PeerGroup` class, was not intended for this purpose.  Moreover,\n   the `TorConfig` class has a value, circuitBuildTimeout, apparently\n   for this purpose; at least its default of 60 seconds may be more\n   appropriate for this purpose than the five-second lookup timeout.\n\n2. Currently, the process of opening circuits for the DNS lookups will\n   take exactly as long as the timeout value, no more, no less, which\n   practically guarantees that the client will either wait longer than\n   necessary, or else experience timeout errors that could have been\n   avoided by waiting a bit longer.\n\nThe changes herein use the return value of`TorConfig.getCircuitBuildTimeout()`\nas the timeout for opening circuits, rather than using the DNS lookup\ntimeout value that is passed by `PeerGroup` as an argument to\n`PeerDiscovery.getPeers()`.  Moreover, as soon as a circuit either has\nbeen opened or failed to be opened for each router, the DNS lookups\nthen begin without waiting for the timeout time to elapse.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. There are no tests with these changes.  There don't seem to be any\n   tests for the `TorDiscovery` class.  There probably ought to be.\n\n2. The `TorDiscovery` class's DNS lookup procedure has the same\n   timeout characteristic as the one this patch removes from the\n   circuit-opening procedure, namely it waits for as long as the\n   timeout value, no more no less.  If the changes proposed in this\n   patch are acceptable, I would consider making the same change for\n   the process of looking up the peer IP numbers.\n"},{"hash":"3e5e3496ea3d57992597442219fc99232e8d0517","date":"2014-09-10T15:59:41.000Z","author":{"name":"Andreas Schildbach","email":"andreas@schildbach.de"},"message":"Introduce textual checkpoint format.
